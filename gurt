  <h1>Oliver's Day Out</h1>
  <p>One sunny afternoon, Oliver walked to the store looking for something new. As he strolled past the shelves, something shiny caught his eye — it was Diddy's new oil brand, fresh on display.</p>
  <p>"This looks interesting," Oliver said, picking up a bottle.</p>
  <p>He bought it, headed home, and decided to make dinner. He grilled up a juicy hamburger, added some of the new oil to the pan, and took a big bite.</p>
  <p>It was the best burger he had ever eaten.</p>
  <p>And so, Oliver’s ordinary trip to the store turned into a delicious memory.</p>
